# Read-temperature-sensor-with-Arduino
Read multiple temperature sensor with Arduino Mega 2560 and store the measurements in a datalogger.

Arduino code for implement a temperature sensors datalogger. Including DS18B20 digital temperature sensors, MLX90614 IR temperature sensors, K-thermocouples through the Maxim 6675 modules, thermo-resistance PT-100 using the HX711 module, LM335 analog temperature sensors and termistor temperature sensors. A DHT22 relative humidity and temperature sensor is also used.
